[ ] The SettingsRange class needs some work to support new abstraction.
[ ] CrossSection needs some cleanup internally.
[ ] GCode Parser / Writers need refactor.
[ ] Add a spline segment type.
[ ] Integrate graph/circlepack into the rest of the project.
[ ] SettingsManager and SessionManger need to be cleaned and reworked for new abstraction. They could be merged if desired.
[ ] SessionManger needs embossing functions/objects removed.
[ ] The Order Optimizer's interface needs some work. It has been mentioned that this could be abstract.
[ ] The Part and PartBase need to be remerged since new abstraction does not need this. Emboss wall can also be removed and replaced with settings.
[ ] Caching needs to be reimplemented on the regions. As an idea, maybe this could take the form of a subscription interface in the SettingsManager.
[ ] Add more island types.
[ ] Add more region types.
[ ] Add more Step types.
[ ] Integrate supports into new abstraction.
[ ] Add more slicer threads.
[ ] Mesh loader needs to be faster than it is.
[ ] Session loader needs to be refactored.
[ ] LayerBar needs some work to be completely compatable with the new abstraction.
[ ] SettingsBar (SettingsTab specifically) needs to be refactored. InputRow subclass should be an abstract class to represent different inputs rather than the function pointer arrangement that exists now.
[ ] SettingsBar needs to be able to support lists of settings.
[ ] SettingsBar needs to talk with LayerBar to generate settings.
[ ] SettingsBar needs to hide settings when unneeded.
[ ] GCodeBar needs some UI cleanup (add labels, etc.)
[ ] More dialogs for the different slicer types.
[ ] Clean up main window.
[ ] Default template configurations.
[ ] Window styles.
[ ] Remove last remaining UI file (ui/gui/windows/preferences_window.h).
