This project hosts our copy of the bost lib. The files are in the boost folder because this is where BOOST_ROOT is. If boost needs updated, go to https://www.boost.org/ and download the latest .zip file. Extract the contents to the root of this project.

## The current bost version this mirror is using is 1.79.0
